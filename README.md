# Customer Churn Model
## Goal:
Demonstrate data cleaning techniques and pre-processing for ML models with an open source dataset.

## Notes:
Since customer churn modeling is something that I plan to do at work in the near future I looked for a dataset that would need some cleaning and that is relevant subject matter.

## Code Structure:
The colab notebook is divided in to the below main sections that illustrate a model cleaning and prep-process that can be mirrored in many different projects.
Markup : 1. Data Loading
